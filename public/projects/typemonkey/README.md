1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd typing-test-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   # or
   bun install

   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to start typing!

## How to Use

### Starting a Test

1. **Choose your timer** - Select from 15s, 30s, 60s, or custom durations
2. **Begin typing** - Click in the text area or start typing immediately
3. **Stay focused** - The app prevents mouse interference while you're typing
4. **Complete the test** - Finish before time runs out or complete all words

### Understanding Your Results

- **WPM**: Your typing speed in words per minute
- **Raw Speed**: Unfiltered typing speed including mistakes
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly typed characters
- **Consistency**: How stable your typing speed was throughout the test
- **Chart Analysis**: Visual representation of your performance over time

### Customization

- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between light and dark modes
- **Timer Settings**: Adjust test duration to your preference
- **Reset/Restart**: Start a new test anytime with fresh words
